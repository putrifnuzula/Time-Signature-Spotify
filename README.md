# Time Signature Spotify
This project aims to offer useful insights into how time signatures show up in hit songs, helping music lovers and professionals better understand rhythmic trends in a wide range of top Spotify tracks.

# Objectives:
To explore the time signature of the top 100 songs, a dataset from Kaggle with Spotify track data was used. The "time_signature" was analyzed to see if certain patterns, like the common 4/4, appear more often in popular songs. Build a predictive model using several machine learning algorithms, such as, SVM, AdaBoost, and Random Forest.
